# discadminecraft
A discord bot to interact with your minecraft server.
## Install for Linux
1. Install Java for your distribution.
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/tarneaux/discadminecraft`
3. CD into id: `cd discadminecraft`
4. Run the setup script: `python3 main.py` <br>

You should always have one instance of the Discord bot and one instance of the Minecraft server. <br>
For the discord bot, the Raspberry pi is a perfect choice if you want it to always be online. <br>
The prefix for discord bot commands is `&`. <br>

## Contributing
Open a pull request, and I'll be glad to accept modifications, especially for performance (starting the server currently takes 5x more time that without discadminecraft)
